# Configuration Management Guide

This document explains the configuration management system for Migration Insights using environment variables.

## Prerequisites

**Python 3.11+** is required to run Migration Insights. See [README.md](README.md) for complete installation instructions.

For **mongosync** version compatibility, see [README.md — mongosync compatibility](README.md#mongosync-compatibility).

For **migration-verifier** version compatibility, see [README.md — Migration Verifier compatibility](README.md#migration-verifier-compatibility).

## Configuration Overview

Migration Insights is configured entirely through **environment variables**. No configuration files are used.

For the **Migration Monitoring** dashboard (progress endpoint, metadata fallback, index building, embedded verifier), see **[MIGRATION_MONITORING.md](MIGRATION_MONITORING.md)**.

### **Configuration Priority**

1. **Environment Variables** (highest priority)
2. **Default Values** (lowest priority)

All configuration can be set using `export` commands before running the application, or through your system's environment configuration.

Invalid numeric environment variables or an unrecognized `LOG_LEVEL` cause immediate startup failure with a descriptive error message.

## Environment Variables Reference

### Server Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MI_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Server host address (use `0.0.0.0` for all interfaces) |
| `MI_PORT` | `3030` | Server port number |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) |
| `MI_LOG_FILE` | `insights.log` | Path to log file (used when `MI_LOG_JSON` is false) |
| `MI_LOG_JSON` | `false` | When `true`, emit one JSON object per line on stdout (Kanopy/Splunk) and skip `MI_LOG_FILE`. |

### MongoDB Connection

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MI_CONNECTION_STRING` | _(empty)_ | MongoDB connection string (optional, can be provided via UI) |
| `MI_VERIFIER_CONNECTION_STRING` | _(falls back to `MI_CONNECTION_STRING`)_ | MongoDB connection string for the migration verifier database. When omitted, the value of `MI_CONNECTION_STRING` is used. Set this when the verifier database lives on a different cluster. |
| `MI_MIGRATION_VERIFIER_DB_NAME` | `__mdb_internal_migration_verifier` | Standalone migration-verifier metadata database name. |
| `MI_VERIFIER_GENERATION_LIMIT` | `5` | Maximum generations shown on the Migration Verifier dashboard (1–20). |
| `MI_VERIFIER_FAILED_TASKS_LIMIT` | `20` | Maximum failed document tasks shown on the **Failed Tasks / Document Mismatches** card (1–100). |
| `MI_VERIFIER_SUMMARY_MIN_DURATION_SECS` | `0` | Minimum document-mismatch duration (seconds) passed to migration-verifier `/api/v1/summary` and `/api/v1/docMismatches` (`minDurationSecs` query param). `0` = no filter. |
| `MI_EMBEDDED_VERIFIER_SRC_DB_NAME` | `__mdb_internal_mongosync_verifier_src` | Embedded verifier source persistence database on the destination cluster. |
| `MI_EMBEDDED_VERIFIER_DST_DB_NAME` | `__mdb_internal_mongosync_verifier_dst` | Embedded verifier destination persistence database on the destination cluster. |
| `MI_POOL_SIZE` | `10` | MongoDB connection pool size |
| `MI_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | MongoDB connection timeout in milliseconds |
| `MI_VERIFIER_METADATA_TIMEOUT_MS` | `120000` | Socket timeout in milliseconds for Migration Verifier metadata DB reads (`verification_tasks` aggregations). Does not affect mongosync live monitoring or general `get_database()` calls. |

### Migration Monitoring Settings

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MI_REFRESH_TIME` | `10` | Base refresh interval in seconds. Must be an integer from 1 to 60, matching the sidebar **Settings** control. **Migration Monitoring** dashboard polls at this interval. **Migration Verifier** dashboard uses multiples of this value: **progress** = 3× (default 30s), **metadata** = 6× (default 60s). Changing the sidebar refresh updates Migration Monitoring directly and rescales both verifier intervals proportionally. The sidebar **Settings** control overrides this per browser session (stored in `sessionStorage`); it does not update the server env var. |
| `MI_MONGOSYNC_PROGRESS_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `MI_REFRESH_TIME` | HTTP timeout in seconds for mongosync `/api/v1/progress` polling |
| `MI_VERIFIER_PROGRESS_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `MI_REFRESH_TIME × 3` | HTTP timeout in seconds for migration-verifier `/api/v1/progress` polling |
| `MI_VERIFIER_HEAVY_API_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `600` | HTTP timeout in seconds for migration-verifier `/api/v1/summary` (manual mismatch summary), mismatch download streams (`/api/v1/docMismatches`, `/api/v1/nsMismatches`), and the post-run summary cooldown. Applies to connect and idle time between streamed chunks for downloads. |
| `MI_INDEX_BUILD_REFRESH_TIME` | `60` | Minimum interval in seconds between destination `list_indexes` scans used for approximate metadata index-building progress (counter reads still run every poll). See [MIGRATION_MONITORING.md](MIGRATION_MONITORING.md). |
| `MI_PROGRESS_ENDPOINT_URL` | _(empty)_ | Mongosync progress endpoint as `host:port` or `host:port/api/v1/progress` (default port **27182**; path `/api/v1/progress` is appended if omitted). Optional — can also be set via UI **host** and **port** fields on the Migration monitoring home page. Leave host empty in the UI to skip the endpoint. |
| `MI_VERIFIER_PROGRESS_ENDPOINT_URL` | _(empty)_ | Migration Verifier progress endpoint as `host:port` or `host:port/api/v1/progress` (default port **27020**; path `/api/v1/progress` is appended if omitted). Optional — can also be set via UI **host** and **port** fields on the Migration monitoring home page (standalone verifier section). Leave host empty in the UI to skip the endpoint. |
| `MI_ALLOWED_ENDPOINT_HOSTS` | _(empty)_ | Comma-separated allowlist of hosts that mongosync/verifier endpoints may point at (for example `mongosync-1.internal,10.0.0.5`). Empty means any host entered in the UI is accepted. Set this when the app is reachable by anyone other than the operator. |

> **Note**: Progress, summary, and mismatch requests are sent to exactly the validated `host:port` and API path — HTTP redirects returned by the endpoint are **not** followed, so a misconfigured or hostile endpoint cannot steer the fetch to another URL. A redirect surfaces as an endpoint error in the UI. Point the variable directly at the mongosync/verifier API host and port, not at a proxy that redirects.

### Security Settings

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MI_SECURE_COOKIES` | mirrors `MI_SSL_ENABLED` (`false` when HTTPS is off) | Enable secure cookies (set `true` when using HTTPS) |
| `MI_SESSION_TIMEOUT` | `3600` | Session timeout in seconds (1 hour default). Creating a session also sweeps any expired entries still held in memory. |
| `MI_SESSION_MAX` | `256` | Maximum in-memory sessions. When full, the oldest sessions (by last access) are evicted before a new one is created. |
| `MI_SSL_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable HTTPS/SSL in Flask application |
| `MI_SSL_CERT` | `/etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain/fullchain.pem` | Path to SSL certificate file |
| `MI_SSL_KEY` | `/etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain/privkey.pem` | Path to SSL private key file |

> **Note**: Sessions are stored **in-memory** on the server. All active sessions are lost when the application restarts. This is by design to avoid persisting sensitive data (such as connection strings) to disk. A unified monitoring session may hold mongosync and optional standalone Migration Verifier credentials submitted from `/live/`. Use **Logout** to clear the session cookie, stored credentials, MongoDB client caches, and the destination index-build scan cache.

> **Note**: For detailed HTTPS setup instructions, see [HTTPS_SETUP.md](HTTPS_SETUP.md)

#### Deployment Trust Model

Migration Insights has **no user authentication**: anyone who can reach the app can use every feature, including submitting connection strings and pointing the monitoring forms at a host of their choosing. It is designed to run next to a migration as a single-operator diagnostic tool.

Deploy it accordingly:

- Bind to `MI_HOST=127.0.0.1` and reach it over an SSH tunnel, or restrict access with a firewall or VPN
- If it must be reachable on a shared network, put an authenticating reverse proxy in front of it (see [HTTPS_SETUP.md](HTTPS_SETUP.md)) and set `MI_ALLOWED_ENDPOINT_HOSTS`
- Pre-set `MI_PROGRESS_ENDPOINT_URL` / `MI_VERIFIER_PROGRESS_ENDPOINT_URL`: when these are set, the environment value wins and the UI form fields are ignored

### Connection String Validation

> **Note**: For connection string handling information, see [CONNECTION_STRING.md](CONNECTION_STRING.md)

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Local Development

Default settings - no environment variables needed:

```bash
# Run with all defaults
python3 migration_insights.py

# Access at: http://127.0.0.1:3030
```

### Example 2: Custom Port and Host

Run on a different port and allow external connections:

```bash
# Set custom port and host
export MI_PORT=8080
export MI_HOST=0.0.0.0

# Run the application
python3 migration_insights.py

# Access at: http://your-ip:8080
```

### Example 3: Pre-configured MongoDB Connection

Set the MongoDB connection string for metadata-only monitoring, or as metadata fallback when a progress endpoint is also configured:

```bash
# Optional: metadata-only monitoring, or metadata fallback when a progress endpoint is also set
export MI_CONNECTION_STRING="mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/"

# Optional: Adjust refresh rate
export MI_REFRESH_TIME=5

# Run the application
python3 migration_insights.py
```

### Example 3b: Combined Monitoring (Metadata + Progress Endpoint)

Pre-configure both the progress endpoint and connection string for comprehensive monitoring. In the UI, the equivalent is entering a **host** and **port** (default `27182`) on the Migration monitoring home page; leave host empty for metadata-only mode.

```bash
# Set mongosync progress endpoint (host:port or full path; /api/v1/progress is appended if omitted)
export MI_PROGRESS_ENDPOINT_URL="localhost:27182"

# Optional: metadata fallback — destination cluster connection string
export MI_CONNECTION_STRING="mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/"

# Optional: throttle destination index-name verification scans (metadata fallback)
export MI_INDEX_BUILD_REFRESH_TIME=60

# Faster refresh for active migrations
export MI_REFRESH_TIME=5

# Optional: HTTP timeout for mongosync /api/v1/progress (defaults to MI_REFRESH_TIME)
export MI_MONGOSYNC_PROGRESS_TIMEOUT_SECS=5

# Run the application
python3 migration_insights.py
```

### Example 4: Debug Mode with Logging

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
# Enable debug logging
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
export MI_LOG_FILE=/var/log/migration-insights/debug.log

# Run the application
python3 migration_insights.py

# Tail the log in another terminal
tail -f /var/log/migration-insights/debug.log
```

### Example 5: Production Configuration with HTTPS

Secure production setup with HTTPS:

```bash
# Server configuration
export MI_HOST=127.0.0.1  # Behind reverse proxy
export MI_PORT=3030
export LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Security settings
export MI_SSL_ENABLED=false  # Nginx handles SSL
export MI_SECURE_COOKIES=true

# Restrict which hosts operators can point progress/verifier endpoints at (shared networks)
export MI_ALLOWED_ENDPOINT_HOSTS="mongosync-1.internal,10.0.0.5"

# MongoDB connection (optional: metadata-only, or metadata fallback when a progress endpoint is also set)
export MI_CONNECTION_STRING="mongodb+srv://user:pass@production-cluster.mongodb.net/"

# Performance settings
export MI_POOL_SIZE=20
export MI_TIMEOUT_MS=10000

# Run the application
python3 migration_insights.py
```

See [HTTPS_SETUP.md](HTTPS_SETUP.md) for complete production deployment guide.

### Example 6: Migration Verifier Monitoring

Pre-configure the migration-verifier progress endpoint and/or connection string:

```bash
# Set migration-verifier progress endpoint (host:port or full path; /api/v1/progress is appended if omitted)
export MI_VERIFIER_PROGRESS_ENDPOINT_URL="localhost:27020"

# Optional: metadata fallback — used when MI_VERIFIER_CONNECTION_STRING is not set
export MI_CONNECTION_STRING="mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/"

# Optional: metadata fallback on a different cluster (falls back to MI_CONNECTION_STRING when omitted)
export MI_VERIFIER_CONNECTION_STRING="mongodb+srv://user:pass@verifier-cluster.mongodb.net/"

# Optional: override migration-verifier metadata database name (default: __mdb_internal_migration_verifier)
export MI_MIGRATION_VERIFIER_DB_NAME="__mdb_internal_migration_verifier"

# Optional: number of generations shown on the verifier dashboard (default: 5, range: 1–20)
export MI_VERIFIER_GENERATION_LIMIT=10

# Cap failed document tasks shown on the dashboard (default 20)
export MI_VERIFIER_FAILED_TASKS_LIMIT=20

# Optional: ignore short-lived doc mismatches in /summary (0 = no filter)
export MI_VERIFIER_SUMMARY_MIN_DURATION_SECS=0

# HTTP timeouts for verifier endpoint polling (seconds; defaults follow refresh intervals)
export MI_VERIFIER_PROGRESS_TIMEOUT_SECS=30
export MI_VERIFIER_HEAVY_API_TIMEOUT_SECS=600

# Socket timeout for verifier metadata DB reads (milliseconds)
export MI_VERIFIER_METADATA_TIMEOUT_MS=120000

# Run the application
python3 migration_insights.py
```

**Note**: When `MI_VERIFIER_CONNECTION_STRING` is not set, it falls back to `MI_CONNECTION_STRING`. Set it explicitly when the migration-verifier writes to a different cluster. The verifier metadata database name is not configurable via the UI; use `MI_MIGRATION_VERIFIER_DB_NAME` to override the default. Provide at least one of the progress endpoint or connection string (via env or UI).

## Troubleshooting

### Environment Variables Not Taking Effect

**Problem**: Changed environment variables but application uses defaults

**Solution**: 
```bash
# Verify variables are set
env | grep MI_

# Use -E flag with sudo to preserve environment
sudo -E python3 migration_insights.py
```

### Connection String Not Working

**Problem**: `MI_CONNECTION_STRING` is set but application still asks for it

**Solution**: 
- Verify the connection string format: `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/`
- Check for extra quotes or spaces
- Test connection string with `mongosh` first
- Pre-set env vars apply to Migration monitoring when not overridden by a session; clear cookies or restart the app if a prior session is cached

### Progress Endpoint Not Responding

**Problem**: Migration Monitoring shows a progress-endpoint warning

**Solution**:
- Confirm mongosync is running and its API is reachable on the host/port you entered (default port **27182**)
- Verify `MI_PROGRESS_ENDPOINT_URL` uses `host:port` or `host:port/api/v1/progress` (no `http://` required in env)
- Metadata-only monitoring still works if `MI_CONNECTION_STRING` is set; leave the progress **host** empty in the UI to skip the endpoint intentionally

### Verifier Metadata Connection Errors

**Problem**: Migration Verifier dashboard shows a generic metadata connection error

**Solution**:
- The UI shows generic messages such as `Could not connect to verifier database.` — driver details are written to `insights.log` only
- Verify `MI_VERIFIER_CONNECTION_STRING` (or `MI_CONNECTION_STRING` fallback) with `mongosh`
- Check network access, credentials, and that `MI_MIGRATION_VERIFIER_DB_NAME` exists on the cluster

### Log File Permission Denied

**Problem**: Cannot write to log file location

**Solution**:
```bash
# Use writable location
export MI_LOG_FILE=$HOME/migration-insights.log

# Or create directory with proper permissions
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/migration-insights
sudo chown $USER:$USER /var/log/migration-insights
export MI_LOG_FILE=/var/log/migration-insights/insights.log
```
