# Connection String Guide

This document covers connection string best practices, security considerations, and troubleshooting for Migration Insights.

## Connection String Formats

### MongoDB Atlas (SRV)

Use the SRV connection string format:

```
mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/
```

### Standard Connection String

```
mongodb://username:password@host1:27017,host2:27017/
```

### URL Encoding

Special characters in passwords must be URL-encoded:

- `@` becomes `%40`
- `:` becomes `%3A`
- `/` becomes `%2F`
- `?` becomes `%3F`
- `#` becomes `%23`

Example:
```
# Password: p@ss:word
mongodb://user:p%40ss%3Aword@cluster.mongodb.net/
```

## Using Environment Variables

For production, store the connection string in an environment variable to avoid entering it through the web UI:

```bash
export MI_CONNECTION_STRING="mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/"
python3 migration_insights.py
```

The unified `/live/` setup form uses a **single shared destination connection string** for mongosync metadata and standalone verifier metadata when `__mdb_internal_migration_verifier` is found on that cluster.

For **Migration Verifier** metadata on a **different** cluster than mongosync (env-only override; no separate field in the UI):

```bash
export MI_VERIFIER_CONNECTION_STRING="mongodb+srv://user:pass@verifier-cluster.mongodb.net/"
```

When `MI_VERIFIER_CONNECTION_STRING` is not set, it falls back to `MI_CONNECTION_STRING`.

See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) for all available connection-related environment variables.

## Security Considerations

- **Credentials are never displayed on live dashboards:** Monitoring and verifier pages show **Progress API** / **Metadata** toolbar badges only — no hostnames, ports, connection strings, or database names. The migration monitoring home page shows **sanitized** connection details (credentials stripped) when env vars are pre-configured.
- **Credentials are never logged:** Connection strings with passwords are not written to log files
- **Generic API errors:** Verifier metadata connection failures return generic messages in the browser (for example, `Could not connect to verifier database.`). Check `insights.log` for driver-level details
- **Endpoint host allowlist:** On shared networks, set `MI_ALLOWED_ENDPOINT_HOSTS` so operators can only point progress/verifier endpoints at known hosts. See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md#deployment-trust-model)
- **HTTPS recommended:** For production deployments, always use HTTPS to protect connection strings in transit. See [HTTPS_SETUP.md](HTTPS_SETUP.md)
- **Secure cookies:** Enable `MI_SECURE_COOKIES=true` when using HTTPS to ensure session cookies are only transmitted over encrypted connections

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid Connection String" Error

1. Check the URI format starts with `mongodb://` or `mongodb+srv://`
2. Verify all components are properly formatted
3. Ensure special characters in password are URL-encoded
4. Check for typos in the connection string

### "Connection Failed" Error

1. Verify credentials are correct
2. Check network connectivity to MongoDB server
3. Ensure MongoDB server is running
4. Verify firewall allows outbound connections on MongoDB port
5. For Atlas, ensure IP address is whitelisted

### Connection Hangs

1. Check for network timeouts (default: 30 seconds, configurable via `MI_TIMEOUT_MS`)
2. Verify DNS resolution for hostname
3. Ensure no proxy blocking MongoDB traffic

### General Steps

1. Check logs: `insights.log`
2. Verify connection string format
3. Test connection using MongoDB shell or Compass
4. Review MongoDB server logs for authentication failures
