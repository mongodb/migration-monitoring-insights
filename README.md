# Migration Insights (formerly Mongosync Insights)

Web dashboard for real-time **mongosync** Migration Monitoring and migration-verifier tracking.

**Migration monitoring** connects to a running mongosync migration: mongosync progress endpoint, optional destination connection string, embedded verifier (default), and optional standalone Migration Verifier endpoint. It routes to Full Migration, combined Dashboard, or Full Verifier depending on inputs.

See **[MIGRATION_MONITORING.md](MIGRATION_MONITORING.md)** for the unified setup form, routing, data sources, polling, manual mismatch summary, index-building and verifier fallbacks.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** (required)
- **mongosync** — see [mongosync compatibility](#mongosync-compatibility) below
- **migration-verifier** (optional, for Migration Verifier monitoring) — see [Migration Verifier compatibility](#migration-verifier-compatibility) below

## mongosync compatibility

Migration Insights is tested with recent mongosync versions **up to 1.22**.

Earlier and later mongosync versions may work where APIs (for example `/api/v1/progress` and internal metadata databases) are unchanged. Behavior with untested versions is not guaranteed. Validate monitoring panels against your mongosync version before relying on them in production.

## Migration Verifier compatibility

Migration Verifier monitoring in Migration Insights was developed and tested with **migration-verifier 0.2.4**.

Earlier and later migration-verifier versions may work where metadata version and APIs (for example `/api/v1/progress` and internal metadata databases) are unchanged. Behavior with untested versions is not guaranteed. Validate the verifier dashboard against your migration-verifier version before relying on it in production.

## Quick start

Run from source:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt   # if running from source
python3 migration_insights.py
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3030` (default host/port).

For **prebuilt installers** (macOS Apple Silicon, Amazon Linux 2023, Ubuntu, RHEL/CentOS packages), see **[PACKAGING.md](PACKAGING.md)**.

To **configure** host, port, connection strings, refresh intervals, and other settings via environment variables, see **[CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md)**. Example pre-configuration before starting:

```bash
export MI_PROGRESS_ENDPOINT_URL="localhost:27182"
# Optional: metadata fallback — destination cluster connection string
export MI_CONNECTION_STRING="mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/"
python3 migration_insights.py
```

## Development

From source, install dev dependencies and run the test suite:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
python3 -m pytest tests/ -q
```

CI runs the same tests on push and pull request (see `.github/workflows/migration-insights-tests.yml`).
